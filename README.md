# Time-Calculator---python
A calculator to add times together without having to do any of the math!
This project was created because I am studying from several online courses, mostly 
from Udemy.com. Some of the courses I am learning from are very lengthy and filled 
with 10+ sections in each course, so I created this Time Calculator, to be able to 
input the times of each section and then calculate the section as a whole(WITHOUT 
HAVING TO DO ANY OF THE MATH, BECAUSE THE DOING THE ACTUAL MATH REQUIRED TO MANY STEPS), 
so then I would know how long each section is and can base my study time off of the 
length of each section. For example, if I allow my time 3hrs a day to study, and 
section 1 is 30min, section 2 is 2hrs, section 3 is 3hrs, section 4 is 1hr, and 
section 5 is 45min, then I can plan to study sections 1 and 2 on day # 1, section 3 
on day # 2, and sections 4 and 5 on day # 3.
